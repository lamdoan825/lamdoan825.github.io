      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi!! I am Lam Doan. I am an avid computer enthusiast who, on my down time, enjoys getting high scores in games. I am currently striving to become a full stack software developer. Apart of my passion for computers is my love for video games. I enjoy both story games and competitive ones. However, as of late, I've been leaning more towards the competitive side as I find myself playing games like Valorant on my free time. There's something about competing against others and trying to be the best one can be, that has me coming back everytime. Gaming has been the reason for my interest in coding. From playing flash games in elemetary to playing Grand Theft Auto on a Playstation, I began to realize, there's a special kind of prestige to being able to bring a game to life like that. From then on, I began this journey to learn and understand more.
